# Offline Portfolio

We live in an attention-economy where your attention is the thing that all the internet is trying to grab. Unfortunately attention is a very limited resource. So, we find the internet filled with bells, whistles, and ads in every corner that your eye could possibly look. Behind every single one of those images is a team of developers whose sole job is to grab onto you and hold on for as long as possible.

As a result, we find ourselves in a very ironic situation. We're becoming more and more connected to everyone in the world, and yet, we find ourselves less and less able to connect to the person right in front of us.

Consider this an opportunity to cut off the connections and just connect. Me and you. Let's get to know each other a little.

Take a look:
